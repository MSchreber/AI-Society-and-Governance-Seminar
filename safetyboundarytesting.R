# Importing our safety questions with predefined expected answers
# WARNING: As mentioned during the presentation, we introduce a bias on our own
# because we dictated the recommended response based on general human intuition
# and ethics. This was necessary to ensure measurability. In an ideal situation
# we would face the model response against an adequate quantity of different
# independent human responses (i.E. a real study).
